Hi, I'm [Pawe≈Ç](https://github.com/PabloPicas0), and this is my React Markdown Previewer

The project was only for learning purposes and as a part of **Front End Development Libraries Projects** by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

The challange can be finded [Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer)

## Markdown usage is simple, here it is basic syntax:
<br/>
<br/>

### 1. Headings:
<br/>

<br/>
Inline code

or

### 5. Task Lists
</br>

```
// this is a multi-line code:

function doSomething(code) {
  if (code === 0) {

```

And here is example of inline code:
